        image: "![Markdown image](images/Markdown-image.png)"
        narration: |-
            The image property should contain an image in Markdown's image
            format. Which is `![Alt text of the image](Url of the image)`.

            To link an image, you'll either need to copy the image you want to
            use to the `public/images` folder, and then link to it via
            a relative URL: `images/your-image-file.png`, or link to
            an image that is externally hosted.

        image: "![Narration and Block Text](images/Narration-and-Block-Text.png)"
        narration: |-
            The narration property should contain the narration text to
            accompany the image. This `|-` notation here tells YAML that
            the text that come indented after this line is block text.

        image: "![Narrate in Markdown](images/Narrate-in-Markdown.png)"
        narration: |-
            The format of the narration supports Markdown format, so you
            can use all of the various formatting options that Markdown
            gives you.
